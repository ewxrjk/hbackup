Changes in version 0.2
======================

   * The order of index files is now normalised, making it easier to
     compare them.

   * New --hint-file option uses filesystem information to record
     hashes, removing the need to rehash large files.  This can
     significantly speed up some backups.

   * When backing up, hashes are checked for in the repository
     asynchronously.

   * When copying a file into the repo, the data actually written is
     hashed, to detect "underfoot" changes.  The check can be
     suppressed by --no-recheck-hash, for the case where you know
     there will be no change.

   * Various bug fixes.
