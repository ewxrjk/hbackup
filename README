hbackup
=======

hbackup is a tool for efficiently backing up a UNIX filesystem to
another filesystem (for instance on a removable hard disk).  It works
on Linux and Mac OS X.

There are currently two command tools provided: a Python script called
hbackup, and a C++ program called nhbackup.
   

How it works
------------

Backups are performed by writing an index of all the directories and
files on the source filesystem to a single file.  This records their
name, permissions, etc.  For very short files it may also include
their contents but for long files it just includes a hash of the
contents.

There is a separate directory structure which contains a mapping
between hashes and file contents.

Some useful consequences of this design are:

 1) Duplicate files are stored only once on the backup medium.  When
    the second copy is encountered, it is already there in the hash
    directory and so need not be written again.

    Moreover if you back up several hosts to the same medium then
    files common to both hosts, for instance many of the files under
    /usr, only appear once on the backup device.

 2) All backups to the same medium are incremental, for the same
    reason.  When you make a second backup, only the index and new
    files need b e written to the backup medium.

 3) The demands on the backup filesystem are relatively light, and
    FAT32 will suffice.  This makes it easier to share backup devices
    between different platforms.

It should be said that a less useful consequence is that when you
delete old indexes, the removal of files no longer referenced by any
index is a relatively slow and expensive process.


How to use it
-------------

My nightly backups are organized as follows:

   * I have a USB hard disk mounted on /usb.  It's formatted as FAT32.

   * Local backups use the script backup.sfere, run nightly from cron.

   * Remote backups from other hosts use the various rbackup.*
     scripts.  These are invoked by SSH from the machine with the
     backup device, to ensure that only backup is running at once.

See the man page, hbackup.1, for command-line options etc.


Technical Difficulties
----------------------

1. SFTP as implemented by OpenSSH (at the time of writing) does not
   support renames on FAT32 filesystems.  This is because it tries to
   provide a non-overwriting rename with link() and unlink() rather
   than an overwriting rename with rename() (which is what hbackup
   actually wants).

   The Python script hbackup has a --no-rename option which writes
   hash files in place but this is less than satisfactory.  A better
   alternative if backing up over SFTP is to apply openssh.patch and
   install the resulting SFTP server in /usr/local/bin, and use the
   --sftp-server option to nhbackup to access it.

2. Mac OS X is capable of returning filenames from readdir() than
   cannot then be accessed.  Currently hbackup will fail entirely if
   this happens.  nhbackup will skip such files.

   Neither of these are very good, but it's not clear what alternative
   there is.
