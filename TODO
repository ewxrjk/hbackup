- extended attributes for various platforms
- progress indicators
  + when backing up generate file list with sizes in background so we
    can estimate how far through we are
  + when restoring and verifying we can do something similar
- decide whether we can do anything useful with FIFOs and sockets
- remember mapping of root+name+mtime -> hash somewhere for much
  faster, but slightly lower assurance, backup
- record filename encoding [from locale] in index files and auto
  convert on restore
- incrementals, i.e. only back up files after a certain date; and
  restore of same
